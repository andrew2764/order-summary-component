## My process

### Built with

- Vanilla HTML/CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM naming convention

### What I learned

First time in these challenges where I use background images.
I'm also not familiar with using the box-shadow CSS property. So much so that I simply went to https://getcssscan.com/css-box-shadow-examples and copied one of the examples into my code.

```css
.button--primary {
  box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3) 0px 19px 38px,
    rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.22) 0px 15px 12px;
}
```
### Useful resources

As I mentioned earlier. I went to the following link to copy and paste a box-shadow example. I'll need to get myself fabiliar with wititng these up myself.
